    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Cheung Chau</h2>
    <img class="photo" src="img/cc.jpg" width="715" height="400">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Small it may be, but the island of Cheung Chau packs a powerful punch when it comes to attractions. Aside from its annual explosion of Bun Festival fun, Cheung Chau’s temples, seafood restaurants, beaches — and even a pirate’s hideout —  make it an interesting getaway all year round.</p>

    <img class="photo" src="img/cc1.jpg">
    <h3>The Cheung Chau Bun Festival</h3>
    <p>It falls on the fifth to the ninth days of the fourth lunar month. Every year, the people of Cheung Chau get busy making papier-mâché effigies of deities, preparing costumes, baking buns and building a bamboo tower. They’re preparing for the thousands of people that will soon descend upon their tiny island for what Time.com deemed one of the world's 'Top 10 Quirky Local Festivals'.</p>

    <p>It all started with a plague that devastated Cheung Chau in the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911). The islanders built an altar in front of the Pak Tai Temple and petitioned the god Pak Tai to drive off the evil spirits besieging the island, while parading statues of deities through the narrow lanes of their village. The plague ended after the performance of these Taoist rituals and 100 years later the rituals are still performed in a festival that is listed as an intangible part of China’s cultural heritage.</p>

    <p>For the locals, this is the continuation of their customs. The islanders have a strong sense of community and those who have left to work elsewhere will return for this celebration. For the thousands who crowd the ferry boats to the erstwhile pirate haven, this is the spectacular Cheung Chau Bun Festival. The weeklong event includes Taoist ceremonies and music, a parade, lion dances, drum beating and an exciting Bun Scrambling Competition.</p>

    <img class="photo" src="img/cc2.jpg">
    <h3>Cheung Chau Sai Tai Road</h3>
    <p>The tiny island of Cheung Chau has no motorised traffic, making it a welcome getaway for strollers. Follow Sai Tai Road, which heads southwest from the pier and takes you past pleasant coastal scenery and a great selection of popular eateries. This will also lead you in the direction of the respective turfs of a goddess and a pirate – the island’s Tin Hau Temple and Cheung Po Tsai Cave.</p>

    <img class="photo" src="img/cc3.jpg">
    <h3>Kwan Kung Pavillion</h3>
    <p>This pavilion-style temple on the island of Cheung Chau was built in 1973 and houses an eight-foot statue of Kwan Kung, the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD) general who later became deified. The statue is made from an entire camphor tree. In front of the pavilion is an incense burner with two dragons.
        Come here in March when the heady aroma of incense mingles with the sweet smell of cherry blossom.</p>
